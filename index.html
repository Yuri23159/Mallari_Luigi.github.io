    <li>[Verse 1]There are times when I'm lying in my bed
        How I bellow and cry from this stupid get
        And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
        Almost rubbed-out, swelling as I keep on.</li>
        <br>
    
    <li>[Pre-Chorus]</li>
        <li> my face in these cold hands of mine
        Heaven knows how embittered I am</li>
        <br>
    
    <li>[Chorus]</li>
        <li style="color:lightgreen; ">'Cause this angel has flown away from me
        Leaving me with drunken misery
        I should have clipped her wings and made her mine
        For all eternity</li>
    
       <li> Now this angel has flown away from me
        Thought I had the strength to set her free
        Did what I did because I love her so
        Will she ever find her way back home to me? (Oh-oh)</li> 
        <br>
        <li>[Verse 2]</li>
            <li>I'm so tired, I feel like catching forty winks
            Being up all night in this elbow room that puts me in a trance
            Where hopes and dreams come true
            Now my lips are burning, and my eyes are hurting</li>
            <br>
            <li>[Pre-Chorus]</li>
                <li>From this fumes I make, still I light another cigarette, just to pass my time
                Oh, heaven knows how embittered I am</li>
                <br>
                <li>[Chorus]</li>
                    <li>'Cause this angel has flown away from me
                    Leaving me with drunken misery
                    I should have clipped her wings and made her mine
                    For all eternity
                    Now this angel has flown away from me
                    Thought I had the strength to set her free
                    Did what I did because I love her so
                    Will she ever find her way back home to me? (Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh)</li>
